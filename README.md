## Synopsis

Text can often be difficult to read and understand especially for people with functional illiteracy, cognitive impairment, or poor language skills. Easi is a study in text simplification using natural language processing which aims to help students from grades 4-6 by simplifying text to make it easier for them to comprehend the lessons of the subject matter, specifically English.

This study generally aimed to develop Easi: A text simplification mobile app using natural language processing
Specifically:
* To develop an application that scans and extracts texts from pictures using OCR, simplifies the text based on Plain English Language Standards using GPT3, then finally displays the processed text using AR overlay. 
* To determine the accuracy of the program in terms of extracting texts from pictures using OCR, simplifying the text in Plain English using GPT3, and processing text using AR overlay.
* To evaluate the proposed EASI App in terms of its functional stability, performance efficiency, usability, reliability, and security using the ISO-IEC 25010 System Product Quality Evaluation Tool.
